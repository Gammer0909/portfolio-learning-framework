                        <p>I began my journey into software development by trying to make my own video game. However, I quickly learned that there is a lot more to building a video game than simply just sitting down and coding. From writing to 3D modeling to programming, a lot goes into building a video game. But the arguably most important, but often overlooked aspect of this is building a server that connects multiple players together.</p>
                        <p>A large part of many multiplayer games is developing a system for each player to stay updated and communicate, often through a server. While many game developers express much disdain for this process, I found myself interested less in the game development side, but more the server side programming. Designing architectures, endpoints, parameters, managing data flow, and server-side logic quickly became more fascinating to me than developing video games did.</p>
                        <p>I enjoy approaching problems with a strong emphasis on understanding the problem at hand, and how it will affect future development decisions. I prioritize identifying and working in constraints, and understanding the full scope of a problem to effectively develop an effective and maintainable solution. I am particularly interested in how minute design decisions can impact a project over time, and ensuring that I make the right decisions to ensure scalability, security, and a positive developer experience, even when I no longer am working on a project.</p>
                        <p>Currently I am developing my skills as a software engineer through hobby projects, and I plan to attend the University of Oklahoma for Computer Science beginning next fall. I am currently continuing the development of a site to display my portfolio, along with other various projects that solve problems I and many of my classmates encounter in their daily life. This process has taught me the fundamentals of writing backend software and APIs with Golang, and connecting this software with a functional frontend built with JavaScript.</p>
